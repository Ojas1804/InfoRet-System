# FOLDERS:

Dataset/corpus for this assignment is present in the Dataset folder. posting_list.txt and biword_index.txt contain posting lists for single words and biwords respectively.

Indexes folder contains the indexes generated by the program. The indexes are stored in the 
form of a dictionary. The dictionary is stored in a text file.

# THINGS TO ADD:
- Implementing indexes through B+-trees
- Better structure to classes
- Processing proximity queries.
